Dominic is a singer/songwriter raised in BC’s Lower Mainland. Currently based out of Vancouver, he uses his banjo and voice to reach people with his intimate lyrical writing. His music draws inspiration from Hozier, The Amazing Devil, and Pete Seeger, with a very folk-adjacent feel to much of his work. Dominic writes from his life and experiences as someone who grew up in the unique biome that is the Lower Mainland, and as a trans man. He frequently talks about transformation and the natural world in his lyrics, as well as how the expectations of others can’t change the true nature of things.


Dominic first started his love of music at age six, after his older brother had his first piano lesson. Dominic sat down at the piano and refused to move until he got a lesson as well. After years of exams with the Royal Conservatory of Music, and graded performances at places like the Kwantlen Music Festival, Dominic lost touch with what made him fall in love with music, and discontinued lessons and performing in his early twenties. Instead he began developing his skills in mixing and worked as a live sound technician, studying Music Technology at Douglas College. 


But Dominic never stopped looking for that magic he felt when he first sat down at a piano. A magic he found again when he picked up a banjo for the first time. Since then Dominic has been composing and performing around Vancouver at street festivals, in parks, at open mics, and wherever else will give him a place to share his music.
