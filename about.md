He was a classically trained musician from the age of 8 onwards. After discontinuing piano and voice lessons in his early twenties, he started playing banjo and finding joy in music again. He is hugely inspired by the unique biome that is BC, as well as the history that can be found in folk music. His lyrical influences include his experience as a genderfluid trans man.
